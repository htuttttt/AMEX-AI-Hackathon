# AMEX AI Hackathon 2024

## About
This project is for the American Express Innovation Labs AI Hackathon 2024.

Check out our [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BdwP1gcB9yIHLWIVUrlQCC4XPm2wiuc1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107167686371418287831&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Problem Definition:
-	American Express has a Merchant Recommender to help connect an Amex Credit Card Customer with an Amex Merchant (Shop that accepts Amex cards)
- This capability recommends (show on a marketing channel) personalized merchants to Customers, to help Customers discover merchants near to them to shop & increase spend on merchants. These recommended merchants are decided by an algorithm. 
-	A Customer transacting on a recommended merchant within 30 days of recommendation date is tagged as a successful activation. 
-	However, a Customer could have transacted with merchants even though it was not recommended by Amex (organic activations).

The goal is to find merchants for each customer that have maximum ‘Incremental activations’ (and hence minimum organic activations). 
Incremental Activations means activations on merchants that the Customer would not have discovered otherwise, unless recommended.
